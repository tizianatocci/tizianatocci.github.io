My passion for Deep Learning and Image Analysis, developed during my academic studies, led me to pursue an initial internship in image analysis, which I undertook alongside the early stages of my Master’s thesis.  
After my graduation, I gained further experience in Data Analysis under an industry point of view with a focus on ETL, cloud, programming.  
I decided to purse a PhD in bioinformatics to acquire a deeper knowledge on a new and complex field: causality applied to biological data. During this time, I also worked as a practical teacher in biological network reconstruction.

- 10/2022 - ongoing, Paris: **PhD Candidate** at **Institut Curie**  
EuReCa International PhD program (Marie Słodowska-Curie program).  
Field: Bioinformatics.  
Project: **Causal Inference for live cell imaging and single cell multi-omics data**
Data analysis: segmentation, detection and tracking of cells, extraction of statistical features; single cell transcriptomics analysis; application of causal discovery algorithms.  
Python libraries often used: numpy; pandas; matplotlib; skimage; scipy; opencv; tensorflow; utralytics, cellpose (pytorch); cupy  

- 09/2024 - 11/2024, Paris: **Practical Teacher** at **Sorbonne Université**
**Biological networks** and systems biology course.  

- 03/2022 - 07/2022, Rome: **Data Analyst** at **Avanade**  
Specifically, in the first two months I was part of the **Data Analyst Academy** whose focus was on:
**SQL Server** and **T-SQL**; Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing (DWH); **ETL**, SSIS and Talend DI; OLAP, Multidimensional Modeling and SSAS; Data Visualization and **Power BI**; **Python**;  **Azure**.
From May to July, I exercised in group projects concerning Azure, PowerBI and I obtained the **Microsoft Certification: Azure AI Fundamentals**.

- 09/2021 - 10/2021, Rome:  **Curricular Intern in Image Analysis** at **Technoscience Parco scientifico e tecnologico Pontino** 
**Field**: Image Analysis.  
**Description**: Development of a MATLAB algorithm, both for computer and mobile phone, to identify structures, relevant for clinical purposes, inside cells.  
My work strongly contributed to the following **conference paper** presented at 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA):
[Fabry disease automatic recognition through image processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9856583/)
