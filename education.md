My academic studies were focused on Mathematics, Physics and Life Sciences, starting from high school.  
I pursed both my bachelor's and master's degrees at Tor Vergata University of Rome. During my bachelor's, I deepened my knowledge of core engineering subjects such as Math, Physics, Chemistry, while also paying great attention to medical and biological subjects like Biochemistry and Cytology. During my master's, I specialized in Deep Learning and Image Analysis for biomedical and biological data.  
Motivated by my passion for the field, I decided to purse a PhD position abroad to explore causal discovery machine learning algorithms applied in the context of biological data.
