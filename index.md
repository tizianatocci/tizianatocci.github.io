      Hello, I am Tiziana Tocci, a PhD Candidate at Institut Curie.  <br>
      I am a young researcher enthusiastic about subjects at the interface between biology and informatics.<br>
      I am currently conducting my doctoral project at Institut Curie, under the supervision of Hervé Isambert and Pascal Hersen.<br>
      By using novel causal discovery algorithms developed in the Isambert laboratory, our aim is to unconver the causal-effect relationships that govern            the complex         biological systems under study.<br>
      Specifically, I analyze cell microscopy videos and single cell transcriptomics data in order to extract features/variables of interest and uncover the         association         and causality between these properties.<br>
      I am inclined to work in scientific international environments and to participate into the organization of scientific events (member of the Young              Researchers' Seminars committee of my research unit).<br>
